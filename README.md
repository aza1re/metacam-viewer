## Usage

### Video Script

This outputs a video file with the left camera, right camera, and LiDAR data visualized side by side. It also outputs the first frame, if only the first frame is needed and not the video, then the `--first-frame` flag can be used. The `--no-color` flag can be used to disable colorization of the point cloud based on distance from the LiDAR.

Usage:
```
python video_main.py <path_to_data_folder> [--first-frame] [--no-color]
```

Example:
```
python main.py ./data/2025-05-27_11-53-47
```

### Info Script

This outputs the different topics in the data and the format of the LiDAR data.

Usage:
```
python info_main.py <path_to_data_folder>
```

### Viewer Script

This opens a window to visualize the point cloud generated by our algorithm, or by the built-in software of the device using the `--preview` flag.

Usage:
```
python viewer_main.py <path_to_data_folder> [--preview]
```

Example:
```
python viewer_main.py ./data/2025-05-27_11-53-47 --preview
```

## Notes

- The video output seems to have something wrong, it cannot be sent through WhatsApp.
  - For now, workaround can be to use `ffmpeg` to just transcode it:
    ```
    ffmpeg -i output.mp4 transcoded.mp4
    ```
